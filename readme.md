# Typestack

Webpack starter pack using Typescript, Jade, Bootstrap

## Usage

To build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile and bundle the Typescript files and dependencies and minify. The required CSS stylesheets and Jade templates will also be processed. The output can be accessed in the `dist/` folder.

## TODO

- Separate `dev` and `prod` configs
- `dev` setup with watcher and reload
